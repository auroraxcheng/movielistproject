# My Personal Project

## Animated films tracker  
Javascript application that keeps a log of all the films someone has watched 
and wants to watch in two different lists, whilst also returning data analysis 
about the genre and running time of all the media consumed. 

**Who will use it?**
- anyone who wants to keep track of the movies they've watched
- anyone who has a list of films they want to watch that they often forget about
- anyone curious about the statistics of the media they consume 
- anyone interested in anime and films 

*This project is of interest to me* because I enjoy watching anime and 
movies in my free time. I think that having a tracker that logs everything 
I've already watched and movies I've been meaning to watch 
would be useful as someone who can be forgetful sometimes. Additionally, 
being able to see the total hours spent and what genre I watch the most of
would be interesting and help me learn more about my personal taste.
